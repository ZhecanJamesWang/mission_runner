------ Eric is out with Drew to test altitude + hold_time --------
1. Tried launching the quadcopter and it headed directly towards the dorms. Drew took control and brought it down. The quadcopter took control away from him every time it sent a waypoint

2. Launched fine and took off agressively in the direction of C. Not sure if it was going to C or drifting

3. Launched fine and took off agressively in the direction of C. Not sure if it was going to C or drifting. AFTER DOING THIS I CLEARED THE WAYPOINTS.

4. Launched well, drifted towards MH and hovered over the sidewalk while in Launch. Failed five times to send A, sent B correctly, sent C correctly.

5. Launched successfully and went to the same point as in previous run - over the sidewalk towards the MH. Hovered there. Got a low battery signal, we landed by hand.

6. Repowered from last run. Cleared the waypoints manually. Successfully launched, went to C at 9.0 m, want to B at 6.0m, then failed to go to A at 3.0 m. Potentially a height cutoff on waypoints.
