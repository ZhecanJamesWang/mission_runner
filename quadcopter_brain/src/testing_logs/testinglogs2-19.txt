AT THE LOWER CORNER OF THE GREAT LAWN, KAITLIN AND ERIC
IN THE SNOW

We are trying to test hover_in_place on the feature/hover_in_place branch. There
are two possibilities we're testing:
	1) Does just clearing the waypoints make it hover? (Tried on 2/16)
	2) If not, can we send a waypoint at the current point to make it stop?


CAN WE SEND WP TO THE CURRENT POSITION?
Trying to head towards E5, hover, F5, hover, and land.
